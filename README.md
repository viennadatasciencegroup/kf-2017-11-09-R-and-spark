# Integrating R into the big data ecosystem using sparklyR

R is a powerful language for data science, but on its own cant cope with large amounts of big data. sparklyR bridges this gap by connecting R to the hadoop ecosystem using spark via the tidy grammar of dplyR.

**Agenda**
- Types of BigData
- Introduction to Hadoop
- Hadoop Ecosystem
- Introduction to Spark (RDD)
- Spark overview
- Integration of spark with R via sparklyR
- Architecture
- Demo
- Downsides of on spark native languages
- streaming and R?
